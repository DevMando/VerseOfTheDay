## IMPORTANT: Before running the project, you must define the HEADER KEY & VALUE, required by the Verse of the DAy API Definition given to me.
## You can define the values for the key and value in file KLOVE_Mando/Models/Bible.cs (lines 47 & 48).
## A minimum requirement would be to have a local SQL Express Instance available when running the project, as Code First will create the database in the local instance.
